# iPhone Sales Analysis in India
## Project Overview:
Apple iPhones are among the top-selling smartphones worldwide, even though there is intense competition in India's smartphone market, where consumers can get similar technology at a much lower price. Despite this, iPhone sales in India remain high.

In this project, I analyze iPhone sales data in India, collected from Flipkart, one of the leading e-commerce platforms in India. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. This project explores the sales trends, customer preferences, and the impact of pricing and discounting strategies on iPhone sales in India.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about the following:

- Product Name
- Brand
- Sale Price
- MRP (Maximum Retail Price)
- Discount Percentage
- Number of Ratings
- Number of Reviews
- UPC (Unique Product Code)
- Star Rating
- RAM <br>
The dataset has no missing values, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis.

## Analysis and Visualizations:
The analysis covers:

**Descriptive Statistics:** A summary of the dataset with insights into price, ratings, and discounts.<br>
**Top 10 Highest Rated iPhones:** We identify the top 10 highest-rated iPhones based on customer reviews and ratings.<br>
**Number of Ratings & Reviews:** Bar charts showing the number of ratings and reviews for the highest-rated iPhones.<br>
**Sales Price vs. Number of Ratings:** Scatter plot showing the relationship between iPhone sale prices and the number of ratings, with a trendline indicating a negative correlation.<br>
**Discount Percentage vs. Number of Ratings:** A scatter plot that shows how discount percentages affect the number of ratings.<br>

## Key Insights:
**Popular iPhones:** The iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone 8 Plus models are among the most liked and reviewed iPhones in India.<br>
**Sales Trends:** iPhones with lower sale prices tend to have more ratings, indicating higher sales volume.<br>
**Discount Effect:** iPhones with higher discounts receive more ratings, which implies better sales during promotional periods.<br>

## Libraries Used:
**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.<br>
**NumPy:** For numerical computations.<br>
**Plotly Express:** For creating interactive visualizations.<br>

## Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into iPhone sales trends in India, showing how factors like pricing and discounts influence customer purchasing behavior. It highlights the popularity of iPhones in India despite their premium pricing.
